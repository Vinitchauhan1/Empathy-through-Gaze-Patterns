# The Eyeâ€™s Tale: Understanding Empathy through Gaze Patterns

## Description

This repository contains research findings and analysis focused on the intriguing relationship between gaze dynamics and empathy. Leveraging extensive datasets from EyeTzip and Raw Data, we explore the correlation between gaze patterns and empathy levels. Our study employs cutting-edge machine learning models, with a spotlight on the Random Forest Regressor, to uncover the pivotal role of gaze metrics. In-depth insights are revealed through unsupervised learning techniques like K-Means clustering. The implications of this research extend to refining models, expanding datasets, and applying findings in clinical and social contexts, merging psychology and technology in the realm of empathy assessment.
